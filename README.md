## About meðŸ‘‹

I studied Telecommunications Engineering, where I learned the basics of coding and developed two games using assembly language.
My area of focus is web development, primarily in frontend, but I am eager to improve my skills as a backend developer.
Currently studying at 42 London, after completing the Piscine, focusing mainly on C now and C++ in the future.
